Hi All

I just wanted to share with you the plans for AsciiDoc version 9
(http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/version9.html) and explain how we
got to this point.

Yannick Gingras emailed me late September enquiring of any plans for
a Python based installer for AsciiDoc -- he was already some of the
way there and volunteered to do the work. I was enthusiastic but it
was soon apparent that Yannick's efforts were outpacing mine so rather
than hold things back and in the light of the quite considerable
changes in the file layout we decided to start a new major release,
version 9, which is to be managed by Yannick.

In the meantime I will release version 8.2.4 and continue to be
responsible for the 8.x branch.

The plan is that the 8.x branch will coexist with the 9.x one; the only
ongoing v8 enhancements will be relatively minor and will not include
any architectural changes, v8 patches and modifications will be passed
up to v9. The AsciiDoc source and configuration file syntax will be
the same for both v8 and v9.

The feature plan for 9.0 is:
- AsciiDoc easy_installable (done, not fully tested)
- AsciiDoc as a Python module with a decent API (now a module, no API yet)
- AsciiDoc 100% Python: no shell or unportable scripting (not done)

Later in the 9.x branch:
- plugin system for frontend and backends
- plugin system for style-sheets
- distutils commands to produce AsciiDoc rendered documentation of
  Python packages (minimal support now in buildutils)

There is no definitive time frame yet but we can probably expect a
beta of 9.0 before the end of the year.  All ideas and suggestions on
what the API should offer are welcome.

A welcome side benefit of this collaboration is that AsciiDoc is now
published as a Mercurial repostitory which also resulted in a tidy up
of the AAP build files.


Cheers, Stuart
